    <h1>About this Website!</h1>
    <p>
        This website began development in 2018 as a way to accomplish three goals: have a single place to
        store our family recipes that Cait develops and adapts, have a way to plan out monthly meals and
        share these plans with anyone interested, and finally develop a codebase into which my kids can
        contribute. This last reason was the driving force behind creating our own website instead of using
        one of the existing recipe/meal planning sites (though with those we'd be on a free plan and have to
        deal with limited functionality or ads...).
    </p>
    <p>
        I have had people ask if they can have their own accounts on here, and it's definitely getting closer. I need to
        make sure the recipe creation/edit pages are set up nicely and work out the relationships with users accessing
        their own and other users recipes. Once that is complete (a couple weeks) and it should be good to go for a few
        people.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you find a bug in the site, good job! If you are visiting this site, you are likely a friend of
        ours, so just let us know personally. If you don't know us personally, glad you are here! Please

    <h1>What's Planned?</h1>
    <p>
        You can always check the repository for open branches of the code to see what myself and the kids are up to
        on this site. For a detailed list of the plans for each upcoming version of the site, check out our
        <a href="https://github.com/Myoldmopar/Cait.Rocks/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open">milestones</a>.
        The main things we are striving for are to get the codebase ready to accept other users, and
        to enhance the calender experience on mobile.

    <h1>Other Information</h1>
    <p>
        In my opinion, recipes are a free-form expression of taste and creativity. There can be a million
        people making the same recipe and make it different each time, putting their own influence on it.
        That said, there are people who make a living out of coming up with, or providing, recipes. We have
        zero interest in interfering with that venture. This website is not a money making venture...at all.
        If you notice a recipe on this site that you own, and you feel it is your intellectual property,
        just let us know, and we'll take it down. We'll still keep it in our beautiful recipe box in the real life
        kitchen drawer, and we might even change the ingredients/directions to instead be a link to your page
        where you provide the recipe! But just remember, the same recipe for boiled eggs can be found on
        about a million websites right now, so the recipe on this page could have been simply a creative
        coincidence!
