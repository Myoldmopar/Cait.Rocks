bin folder...really?
====================

Yeah I know.  But I have this "about" page on the site, where I want to be able to show the current server version, Git SHA, etc.
This works just fine locally!  But once I deploy to Heroku, those instances don't have Git installed, so it fails.  I am hoping
that this statically built version of the Git binary will simply work on that Linux instance; we'll see!
