Ingredient Serializers
======================

The ingredient serializer is a basic model serializer that relies on much of the rest framework magic to minimize the
amount of extra code required.  The only additional fields on the serializer are ``amount`` and ``measurement``, which
each contain a ``source`` argument pointing to the ``get_FIELD_display`` autogenerated function.  This allows the
serializer to look up the formatted version of the choice fields.
