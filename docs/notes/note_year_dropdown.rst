Year DropDown Select Box?
=========================

Right now we have the year field on the planning class, which is a choice field based on a specific list of years.
This is good.  However, in the HTML, we still hardwire the same number of years.  I think I need to figure out how to
properly generate a form out of the month/year/title fields on the planning class.  Then the form will automatically
use the list created in Python.  My concern is that it will be difficult to integrate Angular stuff in there if we
start going down that path, so that's something to consider.
