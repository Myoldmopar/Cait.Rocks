Views
=====

For these views, I tried to wrap them in ViewSets where it made sense, but really, that sorta pushed things in the wrong
direction.  These are not views into the API, these are simply page views.  In the future, when we have a single-page
Angular-routed view, several of these will not be separate page views, so I won't be updating them now.
