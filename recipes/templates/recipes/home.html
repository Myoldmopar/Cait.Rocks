                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>This is a website where we keep our recipes and organize our meal planning. It is very much a work in
                    progress, and has only been alive for 2 weeks, but it's coming around fast!</p>

                <h1>What can I do here?</h1>
                <p>For now, you can check out Cait's handy work. You can look at the <a
                        href="{% url 'planner:recipes-list' %}">list of recipes</a>, which is currently only a modest
                    few, but will grow to the whole library.</p>

                <h1>Anything else?</h1>
                <p>You can also look at the <a href="{% url 'planner:months-list' %}">monthly plans</a> she has made! Be
                    patient with the formatting of the calendars, as this experience isn't optimized for mobile just
                    yet. For now turn your phone sideways and it should get you close enough.</p>

                <h1>What about my own plans?</h1>
                <p>To make your own calendars, you'll need to have an account to <a href="{% url 'login' %}">login</a>.
                    If you don't have one, just ask her and we can get you one once we set this all up.</p>
